The Vault LLC Database

Partnered Project creating a simple database with a web interface that stored, retrieved, updated, and removed database entries using forms. 
XAMPP was used to create the local SQL server while POST requests are used to send data. 
In this project I wrote the PHP functions which sent / retrieved information from the database, and assisted in creating the SQL script in MySQL WorkBench.
